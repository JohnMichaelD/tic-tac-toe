# tic-tac-toe

what I learned, or got a refresher in :

- css roots, var

- cell.nth(child)

- css grid

- adding simple text (x and o shapes) with css instead of html, so its the same across different browsers

- css before and after element

- css transform

- css units, rem, vh, vw

-- css: display, none, show



## issues i'm having

- spacing issues between columns

- color before
